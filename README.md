This project demonstrates a custom scrollable calendar. The calendar was implemented by subclassing `UICollectionViewController`. I also added a gradient view on top that fades out the top and bottom edges of the calendar to give it a 3D effect.

Within the `ScrollableCalendarViewController` class there are some constants for adjusting the height of the cells and the headers as well as controlling how many months you can scroll in the past and future.
